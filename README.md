## About the project
For quite some time I had WS2812-Strip driven by WLED in my room and I really love the Web-GUI. The only thing that was bothering me was that when I went to bed, I always forgot to turn the light of with my phone. This is where this project comes into play!
Espressif claims on their website that the ESP32-S3-Box-3 is "[...] the ultimate choice for prototyping new projects or building complex AIoT systems. ". So I got a colleague in on my idea, to make a stationary Controller for WLED strips in a network
