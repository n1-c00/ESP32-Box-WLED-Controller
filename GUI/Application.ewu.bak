  // To do:
  // 
  // - Adjust the visible size of your application (the thick blue border). It should \
  // correspond to the size of your target display.
  // 
  // - The simplest way to compose the appearance of the application is to use the \
  // 'Views' and 'Widgets' from the Gallery.
  // 
  // - To react to touch or keyboard events use the templates from the Gallery folder \
  // 'Event Handlers'.
  // 
  // - To perform transitions (animations) use the templates from the Gallery folder \
  // 'Effects'.
  // 
  // - To store values use the 'Variable', 'Array' and 'Property' templates available \
  // in the Gallery folder 'Chora'.
  // 
  // - To implement behavior use the 'Method' and 'Slot Method' templates available \
  // in the Gallery folder 'Chora'.

// 
// - Open the 'Application' component for editing. It represents your entire GUI. \
// Use widgets, views, event handlers and effects from the Gallery to assemble there \
// your desired GUI look and feel.
// 
// - Create your own GUI components, widgets, panels, etc. The Gallery folder 'Component \
// Templates' contains for this purpose various templates you can simply add to the \
// unit and thus start your own component development.
// 
// - You can add your own bitmap and font resources to the unit. Use the templates \
// 'Bitmap Resource' and 'Font Resource' from the Gallery folder 'Resources' for \
// this purpose.
// 
// - You can add here also constants to store e.g. multilingual text fragments. Use \
// for this purpose the template 'Constant' from the Gallery folder 'Chora'.
// 
// - To add an interface for communication with the target device use the template \
// 'Device Interface' from the Gallery folder 'Device'.

           initialization steps. For example, you invoke some 'C' function:

             YourDevice_Initialize();

           The variable 'thisObject' represents the actually initialized instance of the
           Application::DeviceClass. You can store this variable e.g. in the middleware
           and use it whenever the middleware needs to notify the GUI application about
           some state alternation or events. In this manner, the middleware will be able
           to invoke methods of the interface device object.

           For example, you can store 'thisObject' in some global C variable:

             // Declaration of the global C variable
             XObject theDeviceObject;

             // Store the instance in the global variable
             theDeviceObject = thisObject;

           Later use the global variable e.g. to provide the GUI application with events:

             ApplicationDeviceClass__TriggerSomeEvent( theDeviceObject );

           IMPORTANT:
           ----------

           If you store 'thisObject' for later use, don't forget to implement the opposite
           operation in the method 'Done'. Concrete, 'Done' should set the global variable
           again to the value NULL.
